# Buildkite Multi-step Upload Bug

Steps to reproduce:
- Checkout this repository `git clone git@github.com:mitchbne/buildkite-multistep-upload.git && cd buildkite-multistep-upload && echo $PWD`
- Note the output of `echo $PWD`, you'll need it in the very next step.
- Create a pipeline in Buildkite with the following configuration:
  - Repository: `<echo $PWD>.git`
  - Steps:
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - command: "ruby massive_pipeline_creator.rb"
    ```
- Trigger a build in Builkdite
- Run an agent locally using `buildkite-agent start --token $AGENT_TOKEN` (you can create an agent token https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/unclustered/agent_tokens/new)

Result:
```
